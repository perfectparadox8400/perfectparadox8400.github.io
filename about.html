            <h2>About us</h2>
            We are Perfect Paradox 8400, a FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team
            from Cedar City, Utah. Our team of students, ages 12–18, is proudly
            affiliated with the Lions Club and 4-H. Each season, we work
            together to design, build, and program a robot that competes at a
            high level, while developing skills in engineering, coding, and
            collaboration. Just as important, we share our passion for STEM
            through community outreach, service projects, and local
            events—striving to inspire others and make a positive impact in our
            community.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            In the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), teams of students design, build,
            and program a custom robot to complete a series of exciting tasks on
            a themed playing field. Each season brings new challenges that test
            creativity, strategy, and technical skill. Teams compete in
            alliances, combining problem-solving and collaboration to score
            points while showcasing innovation, teamwork, and gracious
            professionalism. Beyond the competition, FTC emphasizes learning,
            leadership, and inspiring a passion for STEM in every participant.

            Last season’s FIRST Tech Challenge was called DIVE℠, under the theme
            “Into the Deep.” Teams explored underwater ecosystems and marine
            science by designing robots to complete aquatic-inspired
            tasks—retrieving, placing, and manipulating game elements across a
            field that mirrored the complexities of the ocean floor. Robots
            operated through both autonomous and driver-controlled phases,
            testing students’ engineering, precision, and adaptability.
            Throughout the season, teams also focused on data analysis, design
            documentation, and sharing their scientific insights—blending
            robotics with environmental curiosity and storytelling.

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            At Perfect Paradox 8400, we tackle each season’s challenge with
            creativity, dedication, and teamwork. From brainstorming designs to
            building and programming our robot, every member contributes their
            skills and ideas to bring our vision to life. We approach obstacles
            as opportunities to learn, experimenting with solutions and refining
            our strategies along the way. Collaboration is at the heart of our
            process—whether it’s working with alliance partners, supporting
            other teams, or sharing our progress with the community. For us, the
            challenge isn’t just about competing—it’s about growing as
            innovators, leaders, and problem-solvers.

              We use a collaborative engineering design process to bring our
              robot ideas to life. Each season starts with researching the
              challenge and identifying the key tasks our robot needs to
              accomplish. We then brainstorm creative solutions, weigh their
              feasibility, and prototype different designs before choosing the
              most effective approach. Using CAD software and 3D printing, we
              design and refine custom parts for our chassis, grabber, and arm.
              Our programming team builds organized, modular code that powers
              precise autonomous navigation and smooth, reliable control during
              matches.

            Together our team builds more than a robot—we build skills,
            friendships, and confidence. Every member takes part in
            brainstorming, prototyping, coding, and testing, learning valuable
            engineering and teamwork skills along the way. The robot is the
            result of our growth and collaboration.
